                <h1>Preface:</h1>
                <h2>Before we begin, there is one thing we must understand. I will prove my point with some questions.</h2>
                <h2>Do you have memorized, every word in the dictionary of your 1st learned language?</h2>
                <h2>Whats 2+2? How about 349.50 + 879.22?</h2>

                <li>The answer to question 1 is no.</li>
                <li>The answer to question 2 is 4 which is common knowledge, but.</li>
                <li>The answer to question 3 is "let me get my calculator and find out".</li>

                <p>Why? Because A: It is impossible to remember every word in any language and B: Although we all know the sum of 2 and 2 is 4, we also have an operation that we can use to get more complex answers, thats the point. Language and math is an order of operation / protocol we use as an over all concept. We dont have to remember every minute detail of it, rather, we want to be familiar with the over all concept so we can look up whatever we don't know and know what to do. What we are learning here is no different.</p>

                <h1>Echo and Print</h1>
                <h2>Echo and print is how we display data on the html page. Any bit of data we work with in PHP can be called and displayed using these.</h2>

                <li>Boolean (T / F)</li>
                <li>Null (Nothing)</li>

                <p>A variable starts with a money / dollar sign $ and then a name we will give the variable. After that we add the content of the variable</p>
